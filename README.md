# Spatial-Autoregressive-Geometric-Mean-Model-
This repository contains the R code to fit the **spatial autoregressive geometric mean model** to spatial count data, such as epidemiological data. The methodology is described in the paper: **_Spatial Autoregressive Modelling of Epidemiological Data: Geometric Mean Model Proposal._**, published in SORT (https://www.idescat.cat/sort/) in 2025.
